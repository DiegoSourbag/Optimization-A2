    "Use this Jupyter Notebook for the first part of the assignment. It contains the model for the Transportation Problem from the exercises. We have studied the version that assumes that the total demand equals the total supply.<BR>\n",

    "However, in real life, most transportation problems are not balanced. To solved unbalanced problems, one can formulate slightly different models: one for problems with total supply > total demand and one for problems with total supply < total demand. Alternatively, we can just simply adjust the data in case we encounter an unbalanced problem and thereby transforming it in an equivalent balanced problem. More specific, we add either a dummy supply node or a dummy demand node, and use the balanced model to solve it.<BR>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the questions for the assignment, do not forget to study the balanced version of the Transportation Problem (see exercise Computer Class 2). The Gurobi model is included here again. See the cell below. In Part (A) use the balanced model to solve an unbalanced problem with data being read from an Excel file. In Part (B) use it for a coaching problem similar to the Linear Assignment Problem. This assignment problem concerns selecting four swimmers for three 4x100m Medley teams (Womens, Mens and Mixed team). See if you select the gold winning team from the European Championship in 2022.\n",
